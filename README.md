# MIT Lecture Video Scraper
I created this Python script to automatically download lecture videos from courses on the MIT OpenCourseWare website (https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm).

## Motivation
The MIT OpenCourseWare website provides lecture videos of some of the MIT courses. All of them are free to download, but one need to go through many clicks in order to download all videos of a certain course. This Python script serves to automate this process by using the BeautifulSoup (a library for pulling data out of HTML and XML) and urllib libraries.

## Dependencies
This script requires the Anaconda environment which can be downloaded here > https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

## Instruction for Windows
1. Put Videoscrapper.py in the directory where you desire to you videos in.
2. Launch an Anaconda command prompt in that directory.
